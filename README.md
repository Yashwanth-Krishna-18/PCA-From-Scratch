# PCA-From-Scratch
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) from Scratch
This repository contains an implementation of PCA (Principal Component Analysis) from scratch using Python and NumPy. The goal is to understand PCA step by step, visualize variance, and compute reconstruction errors.

ðŸ”— Google Colab Notebook: View here

Overview
In this notebook, we:

Center the dataset

Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors

Analyze variance captured by each principal component

Perform reconstruction using one and two components

Visualize the original and reconstructed data

Evaluate reconstruction error

Key Insights
âœ… W1 captures most of the variance
âœ… W2 primarily captures noise
âœ… W1 and W2 are orthogonal

Usage
Open the Colab Notebook from the link above.

Run the cells step by step to understand PCA calculations.

Modify the dataset to experiment with different data distributions.

Technologies Used
Python

NumPy

Matplotlib
